    The main aim of this study is to build a model that can predict the heart disease occurrence, based on a combination of features (risk factors) describing the disease. Different machine learning classification techniques will be implemented and compared upon standard performance metric such as accuracy and F-score.
    Heart Disease Prediction predicts the likelihood of patients getting heart disease.
    There are several factors that increase the risk of heart disease, such as smoking habit, body cholesterol level, and family history of heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and lack of physical exercise.
